## Exercise 1:

+ Create a method named Add, that accepts two integers and returns the sum of those two integers
+ Now create an overload of the Add method to account for being able to add two decimals together
+ Now create another overload of the Add method that returns a string and accepts 3 parameters: 2 integers and 1 boolean
+ If the boolean parameter is equal to true, the Add method will return the sum of the 2 numbers plus the word “dollars” at the end of the string.
+ You must also account for the appropriate grammar of the string - so it can’t be “1 dollars”

For example:
```
“5 dollars”

"1 dollar”

“16 dollars”
```
